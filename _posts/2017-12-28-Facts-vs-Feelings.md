# Facts vs Feeling

## Ernest Hemingway's story

How people will make decisions based o nemotion before facts.

Donald Trump is a better storyteller than Ernest Hemingway. Fellings vesus facts and how they apply to the universal story of the underdog.

Ernest Hemingway, it's said, once wrote the world's shortest novel.

While lunching with frineds, Hemingway wagers each frined that he can craft an entire story in six words. After the pot is assembled, Hemingway writes on a napkin and passes around the table. His frineds take one look and acknowledge the story's brilliance. The dix words on the napkin: "Fore sale: baby shoes, never worn."

So much sadness, so few words.

Hemingway's story is, quite literally, only a single image: that tragic "for sale" sign.

We dont' know what happend before this moment: the story begins after the begining. We dont' know what will happen after this moment: thoe story ends before the end.

Everything is implied at the edges. We're invited to imagine the rest.

s of how you imangine "Babay shoes", there are two powerful lessons here.

One, the power of the story isn't the sign that says "For sale" It's what we imagine about the story. The sotry invites you to control the story and gives you agency.

Two, status quo is never a story. Every  story is the story of change. Your agency is in imagining the changes and how you fell about them. This, by the way, is why your parents told yoiu can do anything you can put your mind to, and also why therapy works.

Thus, with "Baby shoes", you are invited to imagine a family facing the ultimate grief. Once, they were happy. Now, they must fight to be happy again. This is the story of the underdog.It's universal. Hemingway know that.

## Donald Trump knows it better

Donald Trump, it's said, once wrote the world's catchiest campaign slogan.

While sitting in his office in Trump Tower, Donald bet that he could tell the story on the electorate in four words. It would make no nod to civility or diversity or inclusivity -- those values that people assume yoke poeple to a common cause. He wrote it down. He told his lawyers to trademark it. He told his marketers to print it on a hat. Today he's hte President of the United States of America. He still wreas the hat. The slogan: "Make America Great Again".

So much emotion, so few words.

Hemingways' "Baby shoes" gives you ane clear picture of the present: a sign that says "For sale". It pins the story to that moment. You are free to imagine any past. You are free to imagine any future. But you must gein by imagining that sign. Its variables are the past and the future. Its constant is the present.

MAGA does the opposite. MAGA's constants are the past and the future. Its variable is the present. You are free to imagine a great past. You are free to imagine a gret future. But you must begine with whatever your situation is right now.

Another way of saying it:

"Baby shoes" makes a fact applicable to any feeling; MAGA makes a felling applicable to any fact.

And in the battle between facts vs feelings, like Newt Gingrich said, "I'll go with  how people feel."

GAGA is a three-act play in only four words.

The first word -- "(your) make" -- give the reader agency. This word make the slogan both a designation and an exhortation.

The last two worlds -- "Great Again" -- do double work. They say that America was once great (nostalgic past), and Maerica will be great again (hopeful future). This gretness is an assumed worldview. There are no possibilities other than America was great and it will be grate again.

They don't say exactly what that greatness was or will be, but they peg how you feel about the past and the future. They give you a broad range to work with.

America could have been gret because it had ...

America will be great because it will ...

After you've set the past and the future, what's left is the unspoken present. The unspoken present is a variable. The present can be whatever reality you, the reader, are experiencing.

The important point is this: the worse off you are -- the bigger your change in emotional state from past to present -- the more powerfull GANA is to you.

These state changes are why MAGA isn't a throwback to the past. Its' a rallying cry for the future. You were once happy and you will be happy again.

Tell me a story, but don't tell it too strict. Tell me a story I want to tell myself.


Every story is the story of change, and every change is a story. The facts of the story don't much matter. How the facts make you feel does. And no single fact exists in a vacuum.

the fact you tell is of no value, only the impression -- wrote Emerson.
