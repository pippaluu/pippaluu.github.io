# Aristotle's Advice on Friendship

Aristotle outlined two kinds of common friendships that
are more accidental than intentional.

Utility: in this relationship, the two parties are not
in it for the affection of one another, but more so
because each party receives a benefit in exchange.

It's not permanent in nature, and whenever the benefit ends,
so does the relationship that brought the parties together.
This is more common in older folks. An example of this would
be a business or a work relationship. You may enjoy the time
you spend together, but once the situation changes, so does
the nature of your connection.

Pleasure: the source of this friendship is more emotional.
It's often the most short-lived of the relationship. It's
fine for as long as the two parties gain enjoyment through
a mutual interest in something external, but it ends as soon
as either tastes or preferences change. It's more common
in young people. It's frequently seen among college friends
or people who participate on the same sports team. Many young
peole go through different phases in their views on enjoyment,
and quite often, the people in their lives thend to change as
the phase they're in recalibrates over time.

Most of the friendships that many of us have all into these
two categories. It's fine and even necessary, to have accidental
friendships, but there is third form of friendship and
is also the most preferable out there.

This kind of relationship is based on mutual appreciation of
the virtues that the other party holds dear. It's the people
themshelves and the qualites that they represent that provides
the incentive for the two parties to be in the relationship.
This relationship often lasts until the end, and there is
generally a base level of goodness required in each person for
it to exists in the first place.

People that lack empathy or care for others seldom develop this
kind of relationship because, more often than not, their preference
is to look for pleasure or utility. On top of that, friendship of
virtue take time and trust to build.

You're more likely to connect at this level with someone when you've
seen them at their worst and watched them grow from that or if you've
both endured mutual hardship together.

Beyound the depth and intimacy, the beauth of this relationship is that
they automatically include the rewards fo the other two kinds of friendship.
They're pleasurable and beneficial.

When you respect a person and care for them, you gain joy from being
with them. If they're a good enough person to warrant such a relationship
to begin with, then there is utility, too.

These relationships require time and intention, but when they do blossom,
they do so with trust, admiration and awe. They bring with them some of
the sweeter joys that life has to offer.
