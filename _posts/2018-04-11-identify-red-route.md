# Identify Red Routes

**Critical design paths that make or break your app**

Red routes are the critical tasks that deliver the most value to your users. These routes are the foundational user journeys that make your product valuable and typically capture 90% or more of your user's actions.

## Origin of Red Route
Introduced in Lodon in 1991, red routes are major roads on which vehicles are not permitted to stop. Their goal is to allow high traffic volumes to flow freely without obstruction. Typically, red roads are marked with red lines on the sides of the road.

When applied to design, these red roads are critical and frequent paths that users take to complete their tasks.

** Identify Red Routes

- **Critical**. Without these routes, your product would not deliver any value.
- **End-to-end task with multiple steps or actions**, not single events. For example, clicking a "Sign Up" button is an action, not a route. However, user registration from beginning to end would be a route.
- **Frequently utilized**. They will often capture the use case of 90%+ of all users.
- **Built for scale**. They are high volume user journeys that funnel the majority of your product traffic.
- **Key value drivers**. They drive your key business metrics.
- **Objectively successful**. You should be able to clearly define what success looks like.
- **Tied to critical product metric**. Your red routes directly impact your bottom line and have substantial impact on user experience.

## Building a Red Route Matrix

A great exercise is to think about the applications that you use daily and think about your habitual and repetitive tasks. Could these tasks be optimised? Would you use the app if more friction was introduced to these tasks?

**Vertical axis**: Used Rarely, Used Occasionally, Used Frequently, Used Always
**Horizontal axis**: Used by few, Used by some, Used by many, Used by all
