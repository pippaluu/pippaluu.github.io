Phosphate is a major element necessary for root growth and health, but is sometimes lacking in some fertiliser. Trace elements can be applied to the lawn once a year and Spring is the best time to do this. Buffalo grass love a little extra Iron Chelate. Iron Chelate will be availabe for sale right alongside the trace elements in the same size package, for about the same price. All lawns love little extra Iron throgh Winter, so the best time t apply Iron Chelate will be in late Autumn, about a month before Winter sets in.
- Watering buffalo lawn should only ever be done in the mornings, nerver at night. Apply more water but less frequently.
- Monitor the lawn for signs fo stress, and only when the lawn reaches a point of beginning to look stressed, it's time to water again. Find the right frequency for watering our bufflalo lawn to perfection. This usually works out to about once a week.
- Wetting agents should be applied at least once or twice per year, before Summer begins and after Simmer ends.
- 35 to 60 mm is an optimum mowing height for buffalo grass. it's necessary to raise mowing heights prior to and during the Winter season.
- Never remove more than one third of the green leaf in a single mowing.
- Moving lawn every 7days or 2 weeks in Summer. 4 weeks in Winter. Don't leave lawn for longer thatn 4 weeks between mowing in Winter.
- The active ingredient in many lawn weed killers is often **Dicamba**, which would damage or even kill the grass when used on Buffalo lawn. Check for the active ingredient in the herbicide: - **MCPA** and **Bromoxynil** based herbicides are safe for use on Buffalo grass. **Yates Lush Weed Killer** is a preferred week killer for Buffalo grass. Yates Lush will effectively control bindii, clover, jo-jo, catsear, cudweed, dandelion, plantains, thistles, creeping oxalis, capeweed, creeping buttercup and Canadian fleabane in Buffalot grrass. If weeds re=emerge after spraying, repeat the weed spraying again in another 2 weeks.
- Do not spray weeds after spraying the lawn. Do not mow the lawn until one week after mowing.
- Wintergrass is ugly and unsightly weed in buffalo grass. Wintergrass will begin germinating underground in May, and will start emerging from the soil and in our lawns in late May and June. Wintergrass will continue to germinate, grow stronger, start clumping and spreading as the winter months continue into July, August and September. If we have wintergreass this year, ti will be worse next year.
- Wintergrass is easy weed to kill if done at the right time. Wintergrass weed killer is diluted with water in spraying bottle and applied to the entire lawn, not just to the area which appears most affected. Be sure to measure tha lawn before treatment to ensure the correct dosage is applied. Once the winter grass killer is applied to the turf, the lawn is thaen lightly watered, which takes the poison down to the roots and the wintergress where it does its work. We should begin seeing the winttergress die off within 2 weeks.
- Wintergrass must be treeted at the right time of the the year, otherwise the herbicide will have no effect whatsoever in killing the weed. Wintergrass is beest and most easily killed in May, pre-emergent and before we can even see the weed. Treatment done as late as July may not have a good effect, while done in August or September simply will not work.
- Fertilise every two months. Don not apply more fertiliser than recommended as this can damange the lawn. Purchase a hight quality fertiliser from a local fertisiser manufacture, ensure the fertiliser includes Trace Elements and switch to a Winter fertiliser for applications in May and July. There is no need to purchase specific Buffalo lawn fertisers as there are often expensive and give no more benefit to buffalo lawn.
- Appy an inexpensive Iron supplement once a year in Spring or Autum will do wonders for the health of Buffalo lawn. If Buffalo lawn is looking pale, it may need Iron supplement.
- Buffalo grass can be prone to diseae infections such as Brown Patch. Most of thse infections will result in cuircular brown patches on the breass. The best way to control these diseases is to aerate the lawn, cut the grass higher, stop fertilising during the outbreak, ensure to water only in the morning and apply wetting agents if necessary.
