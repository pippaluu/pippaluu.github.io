## What is Order To Cash
Order To Cash, also know as O2C or OTC, refers to the set of business processes for receiving and processing customer sales orders for goods and services and their payment. These proceses are at the heart of all businesses.

**Steps of the Order to Cash Cycle**
1. The cycle begines with the system receiving orders from the customer. this could be via email, Internet, sales person, or by some form of Electronic Data Interchange.
2. The company might event conduct a credit review of the customer fefore accepting the order, especially if they have plans of offering the customer deferred payment options.
3. The order is documented and the company begins the task of fulfilling the order.
4. Once the product has been shipped and delivered, or the service has been fulfilled, the most important stage of the cycle begins with regard to cash management. The invoice is created and sent to the customer for payment.
5. After the customer has made the payment, the accountants note the entry in the general ledger.

**Impact and Challenges of the Order to Cash Management**
- If the sales orders are not noted accurately, then the first stage of the cycle itself would be in peril, and this not a unusual event when the orders are taken manually. When the wrong product is made or the wrong specifications are used, the reputation of the sales is at risk and the subsequennt purchase returns cause losses for the production unit.
- Creating manula invoices takes time, as does sending the bill by courier or post. This delays the payment process and increases the possibilities of erros. This also creates additional work for the accouting department.
- The logistics department is heavily involved in the process as their ability to tranport the goods efficiently, safely and on time plays a major role in the time take for the cycle to be completed. Last minute requests, unforeseen transport changes or damages to cargo can throw the entire cycle out of gear.
- When customers are dissatisfied with the product or service, they could refulse to make payment, or at other times they dwould jus tdefault on their payments. This increases the workload on the collections department and the customer service teams.
- The company does not have liquid cash to spend even though they would have recoreed the sale of goods as a revenue item in their books. The lack of cash inflow affects their working capital, and in large enought aounts the overall finances of the company.

## Account Receivable (AR)
Accounts receivable (AR) is an item in the General Ledger (GL) that shows money owed to a business by customers who have purchased goods or services on credit.

AR is a vital part of a balance sheet. It represents bills that should be paid to a company and could require steps for cllection.

A company's collections department would use an aging report to track and list unpaid invoices by customers and the time for the existence of the bill, usually in increments of 30, 60, 90 days or more. An aging report is a way to determine if a company is doing a good job of cleecting buills and reducing accounts receivables.

See also Factoring. AR can be sold by a company to a factor, such as a bak or toer finacier. Factoring, or the sale of AR raises money for a company and boosts the seller's cash flow, but it also involves paying a fee to the factoring company in return for the faster payment of AR.

## General Ledger (GL)
A general ledger (GL) is a set of numbered accounts a business uses to keep track of its financial transactions and to prepare financial reports. Each account is a nuique record summarise each type of asset, liability, equity, revenue and expense. A chart of accounts lists all of the accounts in the general ledger, which can number in the thousands for a large business.

During the bookkeeping process, other records outside the GL, called journals or daybooks, are used for the daily recording of transactions, such as cash payments toward an invoice, and their totals are posted in corresponding accounts in the GL. In accounting software, the trasactions will instead typically be recoreded in subledgers or modules.

The totals calculated in the GL are then entered in other key financial reports, notably the balance sheet, sometimes called the statement of financial position, which reocrds assests and labilities, and the income statement, whcih show revenues and expenses.

Income stements are considered temporary accounts and closed at the end of the accounting yera. Their net balances, positive or negative, are added to the equity portion of the balance sheet. In constrast, the accounts that feed tinto the balance sheet are permanent accounts used to track the ongoing finacial health of the business.

**Accounting cycle process**
Following the rules of double-entry bookkeeping, each entry in the GL must appear in two places: once as a debit and once as a corresponding credit. And the two added together must equal zero.

** General ledger reconciliation***
At the end of each accounting periid, a trial balance is calculated by listing all the debit and credit accounts and their totals, and separating those with debit balances form the ones with crdit blances. The debit and credit accounts are then totaled to verify that they two are equal. If they aren't, the accountant can look for erros in the accounts an journals.

## Record to Report
R2R is a Finance and Accpouting (F&A) management process which involves collecting, processing and delivering relevant, timely and accurate information used for providing strategic, financial and poerational feedback to understand how a business is performaing. It covers the stemps involved in preparing and reporting the overall accoutns whichch are typically stored in general or nomial ledger. The stemps involved are:
- data extraction
- data collection
- data validation
- data transformation (generation of voucher)
- voucher posting (to general ledger)
- storing vouchers in de-normalise and compressed format
- generting analysis account trial balance or consolidated analysis account trial balaance
